# Databases Cheatsheet - Broad Definitions

## 1. Relational Databases  
Relational databases store data in structured formats using tables with rows and columns. They enforce relationships between data through foreign keys and support SQL for querying.

- **SQL Server**: A Microsoft relational database management system (RDBMS) known for scalability, enterprise features, and integration with .NET.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source RDBMS with advanced features like support for complex queries, JSON data types, and full-text search.

## 2. Search Engines  
Search engines index and search large amounts of unstructured data quickly. They are optimized for full-text search and provide advanced querying capabilities.

- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search engine built on Apache Lucene, used for log and event data analysis, full-text search, and analytics.
- **MeiliSearch**: A fast, lightweight search engine focused on simplicity and user-friendly search experiences.

## 3. NoSQL Databases  
NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and flexibility, often used for large-scale, distributed data storage. They do not require fixed schemas and come in various types like key-value stores, document stores, and column-family stores.

### On-Premises NoSQL  
- **Redis**: An in-memory key-value store known for its speed, supporting data structures like strings, lists, and sets.
- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, offering flexible schemas and scalability.

### Cloud NoSQL  
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: A globally distributed, multi-model database service by Microsoft with multiple consistency levels and support for various data models.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed NoSQL database service by AWS, offering high performance and scalability with a key-value and document data model.
