# SOLID Principles Cheat Sheet

## 1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Customer { get; set; }
    public decimal Amount { get; set; }
}

public class OrderProcessor
{
    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
    {
        // Process the order
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing order {order.Id}");
    }
}

public class OrderPrinter
{
    public void PrintOrderDetails(Order order)
    {
        // Print order details
        Console.WriteLine($"Order Id: {order.Id}, Customer: {order.Customer}, Amount: {order.Amount}");
    }
}
```
Here, the OrderProcessor class has a responsibility related to processing orders, and the OrderPrinter class handles printing. This follows SRP, as each class has a single responsibility.

## 2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Example:
```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area();
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public override double Area() => Width * Height;
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public override double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
}

public class AreaCalculator
{
    public double CalculateArea(Shape shape)
    {
        return shape.Area();
    }
}
```
Here, the Shape class is open for extension (you can add new shape types), but closed for modification (you donâ€™t need to change existing classes). New shapes can be added by creating new classes that inherit Shape.

## 3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Objects of a derived class should be replaceable with objects of the base class without affecting the functionality.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying");
    }
}

public class Sparrow : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sparrow flying");
    }
}

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        // Ostriches cannot fly, but this would violate LSP
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Ostriches cannot fly");
    }
}
```
In the example above, Ostrich violates LSP because it cannot substitute Bird without breaking the behavior. Instead, we might want to make a CanFly check or rework the class design.

## 4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

### Example:
```csharp
public interface IWorker
{
    void Work();
    void Eat();
}

public class Worker : IWorker
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Working");
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating");
    }
}

public interface IWorkOnly
{
    void Work();
}

public class WorkOnlyEmployee : IWorkOnly
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Working only");
    }
}
```
In this example, the IWorker interface violates ISP because it forces classes that don't need to eat to implement the Eat method. IWorkOnly is a better interface for such cases.

## 5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

### Example:
```csharp
public interface IEmailService
{
    void SendEmail(string message);
}

public class EmailService : IEmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending email: {message}");
    }
}

public class Notification
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public Notification(IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public void Notify(string message)
    {
        _emailService.SendEmail(message);
    }
}
```
In this example, the Notification class depends on an abstraction (IEmailService), not the concrete implementation (EmailService). This allows easy substitution and testing.

## Summary:
- **SRP**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **OCP**: A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **LSP**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
- **ISP**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **DIP**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
