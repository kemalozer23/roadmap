Output: "pr"

Constaints:
    length of input string <= 30

##### **Soru12/12:**  Assume that we have an array of positive integers from m to n which includes all odd numbers from m to n except one. Write a function that finds the missing odd number in the list.

Input: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17]
Output: 11

Input: [9, 7, 3]
Output: 5

Constraints:
    1 < nums.length < 100
    there is always a single missing number
    array is sorted either asc or desc
