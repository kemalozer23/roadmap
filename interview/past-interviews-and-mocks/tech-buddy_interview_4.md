## Generate Parantheses:
Given an integer length, generate a valid parantheses pattern of length characters

A valid parantheses pattern must follow these rules:
1. Every open bracket '(' must be closed by a corresponding closing bracket ')' 
2. The parantheses must be correctly nested and balanced, meaning that every open bracket has a corresponding closing bracket that is not preceeded by another closing bracket without a matching opening bracket.

string GeneratePattern(int length) -> length = 6 => "((()))" ||Â "(()())" || "()()()"
